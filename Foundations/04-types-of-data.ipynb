    "### Structured Data  \n",
    "- Conforms to a **data model or schema** and is stored in **tabular form** (e.g., relational databases).  \n",
    "- Commonly generated by enterprise systems like **ERP** and **CRM**.  \n",
    "- Easy to process and store due to widespread tool support.  \n",
    "- Examples: Banking transactions, invoices, customer records.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Unstructured Data  \n",
    "- Does not conform to a data model or schema; makes up **80% of enterprise data**.  \n",
    "- Includes **textual** (e.g., tweets, blog posts) and **binary** (e.g., images, audio, video) files.  \n",
    "- Requires **special-purpose logic** for processing (e.g., codecs for video files).  \n",
    "- Cannot be directly queried with SQL; often stored as **BLOBs** in relational databases or in **NoSQL databases**.  \n",
    "- Grows faster than structured data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Semi-structured Data  \n",
    "- Has some **structure** but is not relational; often **hierarchical** or **graph-based**.  \n",
    "- Commonly stored in **text-based formats** like XML and JSON.  \n",
    "- Easier to process than unstructured data but may require **pre-processing** (e.g., XML validation).  \n",
    "- Examples: EDI files, spreadsheets, RSS feeds, sensor data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata  \n",
    "- Provides **information about a datasetâ€™s characteristics and structure**.  \n",
    "- Mostly **machine-generated** and appended to data.  \n",
    "- Critical for **Big Data** processing, storage, and analysis.  \n",
    "- Examples: XML tags (author, creation date), file attributes (size, resolution).  "
